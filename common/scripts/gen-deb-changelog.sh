# Generate changelog. The version/name of the generated packages are based on this.
#
# Resulting packages are formatted as;
#
# - name of the package (e.g., "docker-ce")
# - version (e.g., "23.0.0~beta.0")
# - pkgRevision (usually "-0", see above), which allows updating packages with
#   packaging-only changes (without a corresponding release of the software
#   that's packaged).
# - distro (e.g., "ubuntu")
# - VERSION_ID (e.g. "22.04" or "11") this must be "sortable" to make sure that
#   packages are upgraded when upgrading to a newer distro version ("codename"
#   cannot be used for this, as they're not sorted)
# - SUITE ("codename"), e.g. "jammy" or "bullseye". This is mostly for convenience,
#   because some places refer to distro versions by codename, others by version.
#   we prefix the codename with a tilde (~), which effectively excludes it from
#   version comparison.
#
# Note that while the `${EPOCH}${EPOCH_SEP}` is part of the version, it is not
# included in the package's *filename*. (And if you're wondering: we needed the
# EPOCH because of our use of CalVer, which made version comparing not work in
# some cases).
#
# Examples:
#
# docker-ce_23.0.0~beta.0-1~debian.11~bullseye_amd64.deb
# docker-ce_23.0.0~beta.0-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy_amd64.deb
